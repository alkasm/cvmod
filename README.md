A collection of useful utilities for computer vision in Python. 

Many of these functions came directly out of Stack Overflow answers that I've provided to add some otherwise missing functionality in OpenCV. Others come from me repeating something I tend to do often.

## Install
    
```sh
pip install cvtools-alkasm
```
